# TimeManagement (Developing)

:alarm_clock: Do you wanna control how much time you spend in each task?


:calendar: Do you wanna plan efficiently the day of tomorrow?


:brain: Do you want to be as focused as possible while doing your tasks?

If the answer is yes, this is the PERFECT application for you.
This application allows you to keep track of the time that you spent in each task by setting a timer while you are working on your task. :man_factory_worker:

Between each timer you can put intervals to rest a bit or not, it's up to you. :slightly_smiling_face:

You can also create a list of things that you pretend to do tomorrow in order for you to have more control of your life. :notebook:

*"I must govern the clock, not be governed by it."*
